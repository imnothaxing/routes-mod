A desktop overlay app built with Flask and PyWebView. Designed to help with managing route data in an intuitive and minimal UI. (LOL what the fuck)

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Windows OS (due to `pywin32`)
- Recommended: use a virtual environment

Install dependencies with:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
